2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell row1/clk_scaled_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) row1/prescaler_reg[0]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[10]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[11]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[12]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[13]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[14]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[1]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[2]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[3]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[4]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[5]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[6]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[7]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[8]/CLR, row1/prescaler_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 15 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
