2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net level_shift/frequency_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin level_shift/frequency_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell level_shift/frequency_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net level_shift/prev_down_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin level_shift/prev_down_reg_i_1/O, cell level_shift/prev_down_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net level_shift/prev_up_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin level_shift/prev_up_reg_i_1/O, cell level_shift/prev_up_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net runner/clock_flash is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin runner/shift_led[3]_i_2/O, cell runner/shift_led[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT runner/shift_led[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 7 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
runner/shift_led_reg[0], runner/shift_led_reg[1], runner/shift_led_reg[1]_lopt_replica, runner/shift_led_reg[2], runner/shift_led_reg[2]_lopt_replica, runner/shift_led_reg[3], runner/shift_led_reg[3]_lopt_replica
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
