If a piece of enhancing technology is dropped by attacking UFOs, it can be used by engineers to gain a temporary power-up of the cannon.<br>
On this page, information is displayed about the potential benefits this may have.<br><br>

<b>Extra Life</b><br>
This technology grants earth's defenders one more chance, as it destroys a landing UFO. You may have no more than 4 lives, which are shown by the LEDs.<br><br>

<b>Big Bullets</b><br>
The bullets fired by the cannon are super-charged, dealing much more damage for a short period of time. Both the cannon and bullets will be glowing hot-white.<br>

<b>Tri-Bullets</b><br>
The cannon now fires three bullets in a cone, allowing it to shoot multiple targets at once, for a short period of time.<br>

<b>Freeze</b><br>
All incoming UFOs are temporarily suspended in mid-air, allowing a short break to destroy them.<br>
