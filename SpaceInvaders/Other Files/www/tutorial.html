<br>
In this game, you will defend Earth from invading UFOs by controlling the mobile cannon on the ground.<br>
This cannon will shoot down the attackers, and hopefully save earth.<br>
The cannon is controlled by using the joystick module on the PCB connected to the XADC, as seen in the picture on the front page.<br>
Pressing on the joystick fires a projectile at the UFOs.<br>
The game speed is controlled by rotating the potentiometer on the same PCB.<br><br>

If a UFO manages to land on the ground, you will lose one of your four lives, as indicated by the green LEDs on the Zybo board.<br>
If all your lives are lost, the game ends.<br><br>
